# Books-recommender-system
Creating a recommendation model which recommends books for users based on read books


At first , three data sets are used for this project which are books dataset , users dataset and ratings dataset.
The project was divided into four parts . The first one is the most important one which is data cleaning where i tried to deal with missing and disturbance values.
The second one is data visualization where i generated plots for different relevant variables.
The fourth part is about building a recommendation system ; in this part i created recommendation model using three techniques which are 
-Popularity-Based Recommendation System
-Collaborative Filtering recommendation system
-Correlations-based recommendation system
Finally , i created a chatbot which is a robot for chatting with users to suggest to them recommended books
